# Enterprise Computing Project 2

This was my submission for project 2. It is a GUI frontend to a database that
allows a user to log in, then submit SQL queries directly to the database.
The application provides a UI to display the results of queries, including
their metadata, and handles errors by displaying popups to the user. See the
project PDF for more details on how it works.
