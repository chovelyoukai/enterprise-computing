# Enterprise Computing Project 3

This was my submission for project 3. It is a web based frontend to a database
that allows the user to submit SQL queries, and see the results. It uses Apache
Servlets to handle the business logic, and JSP to create the frontend UI. See 
the project PDF for more details on how it works.
